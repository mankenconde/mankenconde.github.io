                    <h6>Myself</h6>
                </div>
                <p>My name is Manken Conde and I am a Junior Level Software Engineer. I attended the College of Staten Island as an electrical engineering student but soon realized that it wasn’t exactly what I liked to do. After 2 years of trying to find something I enjoyed, I ended up taking a course in the Engineering curriculum that involved coding in C++ . I enjoyed the course so much that I would go home, do more research and go above and beyond the assignments given by the professor. After successfully completing this course, I knew that Computer Science was the right field for me. I then decided to switch my major to Computer science, despite having already completed more than 2 years of Electrical Engineering. This was because I cared more about doing something I loved than graduating college on time with my peers. I also knew that I wanted to build things and that computer science was what I needed to help me achieve this goal. Ever since I switched my major, I have been working tirelessly to acquire skills that I need to make my projects come to life. I have been working with my peers, mentors, going to meetups, and learning courses online in order to help me achieve this goal. I am now part of the CUNY Tech Prep program, which teaches in-demand technologies like React, Node + Express, and PostgreSQL as well as industry best practices for design, implementation, and deployment such as MVC, version control with Git/GitHub, agile & scrum with Trello and Slack, test driven development, and CI/CD.                </p>
